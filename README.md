# Budget-and-Sales-Analysis

✅ 📊 Power BI Project: Sales vs Budget Performance Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end Sales vs Budget Performance Dashboard in Power BI using real-world retail data. The goal is to analyze how each product and product category is performing against its planned budget across different time periods (MTD, QTD, YTD, YoY).

The dashboard includes advanced time-intelligence calculations, category-level KPIs, and performance flags to help management identify trends, gaps, and growth opportunities.

📁 Dataset Description

This project uses four core tables:

Sales – Contains daily sales transactions

Budget – Monthly allocated budgets per product

Product Master – Product details including Category and Product Name

Date Table – Standard calendar used for all time-intelligence calculations

Measure Table – Contains all created KPIs

🎯 Project Objectives

The project aims to:

Build a clean and scalable data model connecting Sales, Budget, Product, and Calendar tables.

Develop custom DAX measures to evaluate performance at multiple time levels.

Provide insights into:

Sales vs Budget variances

Best and worst performing products

Category performance trends

Year-over-year growth

Create an interactive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard with drill-down capability.

🧩 Data Model Design

A star-schema data model was implemented:

Sales → linked to Product Master

Budget → linked to Product Master

Product Master → acts as product dimension

Date Table → primary date dimension for time intelligence

Relationships support full MTD, QTD, YTD, YoY analysis.
